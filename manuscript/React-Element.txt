# What's a React Element?

Our work with React starts here:

```js
React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi there" }),
```

Let's talk it through. We're using *React* to create an *h1* element.
It's created with a property *children*, evaluating the string "Hi there".

__So, what's a *React Element*?__

*React Element*s are little blue prints for DOM elements.
They are plain old JavaScript objects that describe native DOM elementsâ€”their text, their style, everything.
They also have a handful of special properties that are React-specific.

You can see what a *React Element* looks like by logging it to your Dev Tools console.

Paste this line into your console:

```js
console.log(React.createElement("h1"))
```

The returned object looks like this:

```js
{
  /* a bunch of framework stuff */
  props: {}
  type: "h1",
}
```

### Try it out

Empty *h1*s are boring.
Log out the `createElement` call we're using in our app.
How is it different that the empty `h1`?
