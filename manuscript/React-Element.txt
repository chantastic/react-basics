# What's a React Element?

*React Element*s are like blue prints for creating DOM elements. They are plain old JavaScript objects with a few special properties. Their lightweight and power the famed performance of React. When passed to *ReactDOM.render* they're transformed into DOM elements and inserted into the page.

This whole block should start to make a little bit of sense now.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement('div', { children: "Hi there" }),
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

We're doing three things:

1. __Creating a new *React Element*__, using *React.createElement*
1. __Querying a reference to our single DOM element__, using *document.getElementById*
1. __Rendering our *React Element* into the DOM element container__, using *React.render*

### Try it out

You can see what a React Element looks like by logging it to your Dev Tools console.

Paste this line into your console:

```js
console.log(React.createElement('div', { children: "Hi" }));
```

The returned object should look something like this:

```
{
  /* a bunch of frameworky stuff */
  props: { children: "hi" },
  type: "h1",
}
```

That's our React Elementâ€”our DOM element blueprint.
