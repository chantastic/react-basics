# What's a React Element?

Our work with React starts here:

```js
React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi there" }),
```

Let's talk it through. We're using *React* to create an *h1* element with the *children* "Hi there".

__So, what's a *React Element*?__

*React Element*s are little blue prints for DOM elements.
Under the hood, React uses *document.createElement* to make DOM nodes from these Elements.
They are plain old JavaScript objects with a handful of special properties.

You can see what a *React Element* looks like by logging it to your Dev Tools console.

Paste this line into your console:

```js
console.log(React.createElement("h1"))
```

The returned object looks like this:

```js
{
  /* a bunch of frameworky stuff */
  props: {}
  type: "h1",
}
```

### Try it out

Fiddle around a bit. Empty *h1*s are boring. Log the same object that's being used in our app and see how that *React Element* differs from the empty *h1*.
