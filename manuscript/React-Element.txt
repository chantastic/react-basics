# What's a React Element?

*React Element*s are like blue prints for DOM elements. They are plain old JavaScript objects with a handful of special properties. They're lightweight and enable the famed performance of React. When passed to *ReactDOM.render* they're transformed into DOM elements.

### Try it out

You can see what a *React Element* looks like by logging it to your Dev Tools console.

Paste this line into your console:

```js
console.log(React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi" }));
```

The returned object should look something like this:

```js
{
  /* a bunch of frameworky stuff */
  props: { children: "Hi" },
  type: "h1",
}
```

### Try it out

Fiddle around a bit. Change the *type* and *props* object and see how the output changes.
