# Arrow functions

Arrow functions are a new feature of JavaScript.
They provide a couple niceties over traditional JavaScript functions.

## No `function` keyword

Arrow functions drop the `function` keyword.
Look at these two equivalent examples.

```
// es5
var increment = function (x) { return x + 1 }

// es2015
var increment = (x) => { return x + 1 }
```

## Implicit return

Arrow functions have an implied return, for one-line functions.

```
// es5
var increment = function (x) { return x + 1 }

// es2015
var increment = (x) => x + 1
```

*You'll still have to use a function block and explicit return for functions longer than one line.*

## What this means for React

Because of it's terseness many components are quite often written using arrow functions.

```js
var MyComponent = (props) => React.createElement('div', props)
```
