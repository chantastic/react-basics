# createElement

Now we can talk about our `element` variable.

```js
var element = React.createElement("h1", {children: "Hello!"});
```

`react` is the second of the three libraries we've included.

`React.createElement()` is responsible for creating React Elements.
These the types of elements that `ReactDOM` knows how to render into the browser.

## What's a React Element

React Elements are blueprints for DOM elements.
They *aren't* DOM elements.
They're little objects with specifications for creating DOM elements.

## How to use `React.createElement`

With the first argument, I can specify the "type" of my React Element.
I want this to be a big `h1`.

The second argument is an object to further specify the React Element.
I'm using the special key `children` to specify the child node of my `h1`.
I want the the child element to be the text "Hello!".

### KEEP ALERT!

__All React Elements are created like this.__
I'll test how well you remembered this later.

### Kick the tires
* Change the `type` of our React Element.
* Change the message to be a little more salty that "Hello!".
* __Advanced:__ `children` can be a React Element. Change the value of `children` to be a React Element. You'll need to change this back before moving forward.
