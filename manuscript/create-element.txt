# createElement

Checkout `element` variable.

```js
var element = React.createElement("h1", {children: "Hello!"});
```

`React.createElement()` is creating a React Element for us to render.
React Elements are like blueprints for DOM elements.

With the first argument, I can specify which "type" of element I.
I want this to be a big `h1`.

The second argument is an object of key and value to further specify the Element.
`children` is a special key that specifies any child elements.
I want the the child element to be the text "Hello!".

KEEP ALERT!

__All React Elements are created like this.__
I'll your memory on this later.

### Explore
* Change the `type` of element we're rendering. Maybe make the message a little more salty that "Hello!".
* __Advanced:__ Use `React.createElement()` to provide the value for `children`
