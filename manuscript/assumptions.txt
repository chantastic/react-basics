# Assumptions

* You know elementary HTML.
* You know elementary JavaScript.
* You *don't* know anything about React.js.
* You have an interest in learning React and not gaining jargon for nerd cocktail parties.

You can use React anywhere.

I can't assume you're using React on the same platform that I am. So I'll get into React as quickly as possible. For that reason, I'm going to start with an HTML file with a few script tags.

Once you've learned the basics of React, you can use it wherever you. Chances are someone has already figured out how.
