# Assumptions

I assume you know elementary HTML and JavaScript. You don't need to know anything about React. That's my job.

I assume you know how to make an HTML file, edit it, and open it in a browser.

I assume you know what JavaScript functions, variables, and objects look and can identify them.

I don't make any assumptions about where you'll be using React. We'll setup an HTML document using pre-built scripts so we can get into React quickly. From there, you can take your React knowledge to any platform/framework/stack you want.

I assume you have an interest in learning React and not just learning jargon for nerd cocktail parties.
