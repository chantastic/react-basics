# Assumptions

* You know elementary HTML.
* You know elementary JavaScript.
* You *don't* know anything about React.js.
* You have an interest in learning React and not gaining jargon for nerd cocktail parties.

## You can use React anywhere

You can use React anywhere. So I can't make assumptions about what your app looks like.

My goal is to get into React as quickly as possible. We'll use the simplest starting point I know: an HTML file with a few script tags.

Once you've learned React you can move to any platform/framework/stack you like.
