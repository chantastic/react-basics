# Assumptions

* I assume you know elementary HTML and JavaScript. You don't need to know anything about React. That's my job.

* I assume you know how to make an HTML file, edit it, and open it in a browser.

* I assume you know what JavaScript functions, variables, and objects look and can identify them.

* I assume that you could be using React in any number of frameworks on any number of platforms. So, I don't make assumptions about how our apps will be built and run. This book uses a single HTML document with pre-built scripts. Once you've developed a working knowledge of React, you can adapt it to any platform/framework/stack you want.

* I assume you have an interest in learning React and not gaining jargon for nerd cocktail parties.
