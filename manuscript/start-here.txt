# Start Here

Hi! Thanks for picking up this book.

Let's cut to the chase. I want you to start learning React, today.
I can't help you do that, if we bite off more than we can chew.
You'd skip ahead, see something scary and push it off for another week.
You paid to learn React and that's what you're gonna get.

If you can't teach you everything, I have to teach you the essentials, the
absolutely necessary things. I'm convinced that number of absolutely
necessary things is 10. There are only 10 things you MUST know to make apps in
React.
This book covers those 10 things.

Let's get started!
