# Start Here

Hi! Thanks for picking up this book.

Let's cut to the chase. I want you to start learning React, today.
I can't do that if I try to teach you everything.
You'd skip ahead, see something scary and push it off for another week.
You paid for this book and I want you to get your money's worth TODAY.

If you can't teach you everything, I have to teach you the essentials, the
absolutely necessary things. I'm convinced that the number of absolutely
necessary things is 10. There are only 10 things you MUST know to make apps in
React.
This book covers those 10 things.

Let's get started!
