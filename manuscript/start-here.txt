# Start Here

I like small book with pictures. This is that book for React.js Basics.

You can write React apps after learning 11 things. This book teaches you those 11 things in the right order.

This book isn't a comprehensive guide to React. There are plenty of those you wont Read. This is the book that helps you build you first components and send you on your way.
