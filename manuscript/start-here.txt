# Start here

Let me cut to the chase.
I want you to start learning React, today.

Learning React has probably been on your back burner for months.
Let's put it on the front burner; check it off your list.

This book is written to be totally consumed in about 45 minutes.
You don't need to know anything about React to start.
You don't need to know anything about ES2015 to start.
You don't need to know anything about Node, Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, or Babel at any point in this book.
You just need a modern web browser, a little JavaScript familiarity, and 45 minutes.

If you don't got that, come back when you do.

If you do got that, let's begin.
