# Start Here

I like small book with pictures. This is one of those books for React.js.

You can write React apps after learning 9 things. This book teaches you those 9 things, in the right order.

React offers more than the 11 things in this book. As a beginner, ignore them. They don't exist. Your job is just to start.

Start Here.


## Assumptions

* You understand HTML, script tags and what not
* You are familiar enough to your browsers Dev Tools to log data to a console
* You want to learn things and not just sound cool at nerd-parties
* That's it
