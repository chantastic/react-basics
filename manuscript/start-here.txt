# Start Here

I like small book with pictures. This is the small-book-with-pictures book for React.js Basics.

This book is about React Basics. That means we're going to cover the basics of React. You won't have to symultaniously learn Babel, ES2015, Webpack, and Redux. We'll just cover the basics. You'll just start learning React.

There are 10 or so concepts you need to lodge in your head to start making React work. This book covers those 10-or-so concepts. That's it.

So, if you want to start using React and have about 45 minutes, this book is for you.

Let's begin.
