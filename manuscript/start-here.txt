# Start here

Hi! Thanks for picking up this book.

Let's cut to the chase. I want you to start learning React, today.
I can't help you do that, if we bite off more than we can chew.
You'd skip ahead, see something scary and push it off for another week.
You paid to learn React and that's what you're gonna get.

If you can't teach you everything, I have to teach you the essentials, the
absolutely necessary things. I'm convinced that number of absolutely
necessary things is 10. There are only 10 things you MUST know to make apps in
React.

This book covers those 10 things.

# About you and this book

Before we start, you should have a good idea of what you're getting into and what for.

I want to help you start thinking in React.
To do that, we'll focus on the 10 things you'll need to know as a React developer.
I will not spend any time covering new project setup in this book.
Ok, ok. I'll talk a little bit about it at the end of this book.

Here are a few assumptions about you:

* You **have** a basic understanding of HTML (elements, ids, classes, attributes,etc.)
* You **have** a basic understanding of JavaScript (functions, variables, document.getElementById, etc.)
* You **don't** know anything about React or ES2015 (one of the newest versions of JavaScript).
* You develop in a modern browser.
  - Firefox 51+
  - Chrome 52+
  - Safari 10+
  - Edge 14+

If any of these assumptions is incorrect, put this book down and make them correct.
You might find this book challenging without this knowledge.

If you follow the examples, here's what you can expect to gain:

* A rock solid foundation of React components.
* The ability to read and understand most React documentation.
* The most common ES2015 features used in React development.

Alright. Let's start already!
