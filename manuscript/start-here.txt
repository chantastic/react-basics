# Start Here

Hi! Thanks for picking up this book.

Let's cut to the chase. I want you to start learning React, today.
I can't do that if I try to teach you everything.
You'd skip ahead, see something scary and push it off for another week.
You paid for this book and I want you to get your money's worth TODAY.

If you can't teach you everything, I have to teach you the essentials, the
absolutely necessary things.

I'm convinced that there are only 10 things you MUST know to make apps in React.
This book covers those 10 things.
Just the React.

If you need to learn about node, servers, build tools, state management,
optimization, and all the other things you've heard about, you have the entire
internet at your fingertips.
My goal is just to get you startedâ€”just the React.

Let's get started!
