# ReactDOM.render

ReactDOM is a tiny library for transforming and inserting *React Element*s into the DOM.

*ReacDOM.render* takes two arguments: a *React Element* and a DOM element.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  /* Aa React Element */,
  /* A DOM element container */
);
```

## The DOM Element Container

In our sample app, we get the DOM element we setup in HTML and pass it as the second argument.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  /* A React Element */,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## The React Element

We create *React Elements* with the function *React.creatElement*. Here we're creating a *'div'* and passing in an object with some rendering options.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement('div', { children: "Hi there" }),
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

If all you wanted to learn was how to create a *div* using two external libraries and a lot of back-and-forth to the DOM, you're done!
