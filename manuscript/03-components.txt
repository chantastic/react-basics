# Components

## NOTES

* There are 3 ways to define React Components.
* This one is the easiest. It's also the most limited.
* We'll get to the others when we need them.
* Create element takes a string "div", "span", etc.
  * strings map 1:1 to HTML tags.
* Create element also takes functions. In this case, we're using our Greeting component.

* Now this is pretty boring. If we're going to have reusable components, they need to be customizable.

## CODE

```
var Greeting = function () {
  return React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hi")
}

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Greeting),
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```
