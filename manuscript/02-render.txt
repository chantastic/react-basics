# ReactDOM.render

## What's ReactDOM?

ReactDOM is a tiny library for transforming React elements (we know what those are now!) into DOM elemnts and inserting the into the DOM.

This is referred to as "mounting" a React element.

## `ReactDOM.render` mounts components to the DOM

Now that we know the verbiage, let's "mount" or component to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render`.

`ReactDOM.render` requires only one React Element and one DOM element container.

```
ReactDOM.render(
  /* A React Element */,
  /* A DOM Element Container */
)
```

Use the React Element that we created in the last chapter.

For the DOM Node, use the element that I included in "a basic setup". We can select by using `document.getElementById`.

```
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi" }),
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```

## Hurray!

You mounted your first React component! Make a sandwhich. The rest is easy.
