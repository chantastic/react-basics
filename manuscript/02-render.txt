# ReactDOM.render

## NOTES

* ReactDOM.render has one job. Insert React elements into DOM nodes.
* Only part of React that touches the DOM.
* Separate library because React can be used in more places than the browserâ€”React Native, et al.

## CODE

```
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hi"),
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```
