# ReactDOM.render

## What's ReactDOM?

ReactDOM is a tiny library for transforming React elements (we know what those are now!) into DOM elemnts and inserting the into the DOM.

This is referred to as "mounting" a React element.

## `ReactDOM.render` mounts components to the DOM

Now that we know the verbiage, let's "mount" or component to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render`.

`ReactDOM.render` requires only one React element and one DOM element container.

```
ReactDOM.render(
  /* React element */,
  /* DOM element Container */
)
```

Use the React Element that we created in the last chapter and the DOM elemenent

For the DOM Node, use the element that I included in "a basic setup". We can select by using `document.getElementById`.

All together, it should look like this.

```
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi" }),
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```

## Hurray!

You mounted your first React component! Make yourself a sandwich and bask in the glory.
