# HTML Setup

React works in every popular browser today, right out of the box.
To illustrate that, every example in this book will use this simple HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Learn React Basics</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15.3.2/dist/react.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15.3.2/dist/react-dom.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-core@5.8.38/browser.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <script type="text/babel">
      var element = React.createElement("h1", {children: "Hello!"});
      var container = document.getElementById("root");

      ReactDOM.render(element, container);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Save it somewhere on your local machine and open it in a browser.
You'll see a working React app.

Now, open it in an editor.
We're gonna get our hands dirty.

If you have extra time, type it all in.
You'll learn more than copy/pasting it.

*If you prefer to work in JSFiddle, JSBin, or Codepen, I have sample setups in the last pages of this book.*
