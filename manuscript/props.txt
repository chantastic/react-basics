# Making dynamic components

Rendering static text is not why we got into JavaScript.
Let's bring *Greeting* to life.

We've been able to customize our React Elements by providing an object to `createElement`.
Let's see if we can do that with components we've defined.

Right now, we're not creating `Greeting` with any additional properties.
Properties get passed as an object to ` r rs-ncreateElement`.

```js
React.createElement(Greeting)
```

But we know we can put anything in this object. So, let's give *Greeting* a name.

## props

Remember that *props* object from the *createElement* chapter?
No?
I'll recap:

* The *props* object is a plain old JavaScript object.
* It's the second argument taken by `React.createElement`.
* You can put any key/value pair in the *props* object.
* Some keys get special treatment.

Our *Greeting* component can take this *props* object too.
Let's give the *Greeting* component a name as *props*.
I'll use the value "Chan".
You can use your own name.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Greeting, { name: "Chan" }),
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```

Update the *Greeting* component function to receive *props* and append the name to our output.

``` js
const Greeting = (props) => React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi" + props.name })

var Greeting = function (props) {
  return React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi " + props.name })
}
```

## A word about props

Every component recieves props.
We can put any values we want on the `props` object.
It's how we give values to our components.

This helps us make our components dynamic.

## Rendering values from props

Update the `Greeting` function expression to accept the `props` object.

Now, instead of simply displaying "Hi", let's append the `name` on the `props` object.

``` js
var Greeting = function (props) {
  return React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi " + props.name })
}
```

All together, it should look like this:

``` js
var Greeting = function (props) {
  return React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi " + props.name })
}

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Greeting, { name: "Chan" }),
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```

## props are values communicated to components

The `props` object is how we communicate values into components.
In fact, it's the only way to communicate data into components.

All components take props.
The custome components that we create and those who's types are DOM elements.

## Now, for something completely different

We've talked a lot about custom components and DOM element components.
It'd be nice to have a way writing these components that felt familiar, the way HTML feels familiar.
