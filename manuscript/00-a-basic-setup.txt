# A Basic Setup
Everything in this book fits nicely into a single HTML file.

There are hundreds of ways to write React apps. None of that is critical for learning about React. Here's an HTML file with everything you need to get started.

This file includes 3 libraries: `React`, `ReactDOM` and `Babel-core`. We'll cover what each of those are responsible for in the 11 lessons to follow.

Put all your code in the script tag that is `type="text/babel"`.
