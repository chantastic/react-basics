# A Basic Setup

All examples in this book fit nicely into a single HTML file. Every site on the internet requires at least one HTML file. So, we're in good company.

## Copy and paste this HTML

This basic HTML file is the basis for the first four chapters. Copy it into an HTML file on you computer. Open it in a browser and your favorite code editor.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

  <script src="https://fb.me/react-15.0.2.js"></script>
  <script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.2.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>

  <script>
    // all code goes here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## What comes after chapter 4?

You're already jumping ahead.

We're going to make 2 small changes to support React's optional (but invaluable) JSX syntax.
