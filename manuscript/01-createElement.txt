# Create Elements
You can use JavaScript to create DOM elements.

`document.createElement("h1")`

In React you can use the same verbiage to create a React Element.

`React.createElement("h1")`

This is where the similarities end. React makes it much nicer to append children. We can add some greeting text to this element like so.

`React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello")`

The first argument is the tag name, the third is the innerText but what's the second? It's where optional properties get sent it. We'll talk about that later. For, just leave it as an empty object.

We haven't learned how to put this in our page yet. So, let's `console.log` it to make sure it was created.

`console.log(React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hi"))`

Opening up our developer console, we'll see specification object for this new element.

`
{
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.element),
  /* frameworky stuff */
  props: { children: "hi" },
  type: "h1",
}
`

That's how we create elements using React. But it only exists in memory. Let's render it to the DOM.
