# Create Elements

## NOTES

* How you create elements in React
* Similar to how you createElements with DOM APIs
* Just like with the DOM API, we've only created an element, we need to mount it.

## RESOURCES

* [docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.createelement)

## CODE

```
document.createElement("h1")
React.createElement("h1")
```

```
React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hi")
```

While you won't see much many uses of `createElement` in the wild, you might see it with a `null` instead of `{}`. Don't worry to much about this difference. `{}` is roughly equivalent to `new Object()`. Code that uses `null` is being careful not to instantiate any new objects. You won't need to worry about that for any of the examples in the. And, in 2 chapters I'll show you how to never think about it again.
