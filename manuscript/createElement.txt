# createElement

Now we know that *React Elements* are just objects blue prints for DOM elements.
Let's talk a little more about this `React.createElement` function.

*createElement* takes two arguments, an element *type* and an object of properties.

## Type

The first argument is the type of element you'd like to create.
You can use any tag you would use in HTML, e.g., *"div"*, *"span"*, *"h2"*, *"a"*, etc.
In our app, we're using *"h1".

## Props

The second argument is known as the *props* object.
It's short for "properties".
Here's what you need to know now:

* The *props* object is a JavaScript object.
* You can put any key/value pair into the *props* object.
* Some keys get special treatment.

Our app is using one of the special *props*: *children*.
This special property provides the *innerText* for our *h1*.

*We'll talk about special *props* later.*

#### Try it out

To get your hands dirty, change these things:

* __Change the element type from `h1` to `h2`__. The text should be a little smaller now.
* __Remove the *props* object altogether__. No text will be displayed but peaking in the inspector, you'll see that empty element was rendered.
* __Put the props object back and change the greeting__. "You're a handsome|beautiful devil; What's your name".
