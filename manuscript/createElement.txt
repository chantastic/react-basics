# createElement

This line creates a *React Element*.

```js
React.createElement('div', { children: 'Hi there' }),
```

*React.createElement* takes two arguments. The first is required, the second is optional.

* First, __tag type (as a String)__
* Second, __an object of properties__

In this example, I'm using the *children*, a special proper that (in this case) provides the *innerText* element.

#### Try it out

To get your hands dirty change these things:

* __Change element type from `div` to `h1`__. The text should be bigger and bolder now.
* __Remove the properties object__. No text will be displayed but if you peak in the inspector, the empty element will be rendered.
* __Put the object back, add your own greeting__. "You're a handsome|beautiful devil; What's your name" works.
