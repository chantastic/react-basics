# createElement

This line creates a *React Element*:

```js
React.createElement('div', { children: 'Hi there' }),
```

*React.createElement* takes two arguments. The first is required, the second is optional (but necessary).

## Element type

The first argument is the Element type. It can be a *String* or a *Function*. For any known DOM elements, you'll use a *String*, e.g., *'div'*, *'span'*, *'h2'*, *'anchor'*, etc.

## props

The second argument is known as the *props* object. Right now that shouldn't mean much to you. Here's what you need to know now:

* You can put key/value pairs you want in the *props* object.
* Some keys are special.

In this example, I'm using one of the special keys: *children*. This special property is providing the *innerText* of element.

*We'll talk about which *props* get special treatment later.*

#### Try it out

To get your hands dirty, change these things:

* __Change the element type from `div` to `h1`__. The text should be bigger and bolder now.
* __Remove the *props* object altogether__. No text will be displayed but peaking in the inspector, you'll see that empty element was rendered.
* __Put the props object back and change the greeting__. "You're a handsome|beautiful devil; What's your name" works.
