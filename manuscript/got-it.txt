# Got it?

This block should start to make sense now.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement('div', { children: "Hi there" }),
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

We're doing three things:

1. __Creating a new *React Element*__, using *React.createElement*
1. __Querying a reference to our single DOM element__, using *document.getElementById*
1. __Rendering our *React Element* into the DOM element container__, using *React.render*

### Try it out

If it doesn't all seem reasonable, play around a bit.

1. __Change the id of the DOM element container__. Can you get it working with the new *id*?
1. __Add a couple HTML attributes into the *props* object__. Did they come through in the browser?
