# props

## NOTES

* props are used for communication between components.
* they're the second parameter of createElement
* the object you pass in comes through as props.
  * technically, we could call this anything in our function BUT
    It's convention to use props, for consistency with other
    methods of creating components.
* now, when i said function components were simple, this is all they do. They're literally just functions. They take arguments and return a React element for rendering.

## CODE

```
var Greeting = function (props) {
  return React.createElement("div", {}, "Hi " + props.name)
}

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Greeting, { name: "Chan" }),
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```
