# A Basic Setup

*Copy and paste this into file on your computer.* Open it in a browser to see a basic working React app.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script src="https://fb.me/react-15.0.2.js"></script>
  <script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.2.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>

  <script>
    ReactDOM.render(
      React.createElement('div', { children: "Hi there" }),
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

# A Basic Setup (explained)

There are three distinct sections of this file.

## React and ReactDOM script tags

In the *head* of our HTML file, we're fetching the precompiled version of *React* and *ReactDOM* to kick things off.

```
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script src="https://fb.me/react-15.0.2.js"></script>
  <script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.2.js"></script>
</head>
```

*React* is the main player here and what this book focuses on. **We'll talk about this a lot.**

*ReactDOM* is a handful of functions that allow you to use *React* in the browser. **We won't talk about this much at all.**

## A Single Element

The only element we declare in the HTML body is a single *div* with the id *"root"*. We'll attach our React app to this element.

```
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>

  ...
```

## A Script Tag with React App

Finally, we have the definition of our React app. It doesn't do much yet.

```
  ...

  <script>
    ReactDOM.render(
      React.createElement('div', { children: "Hi there" }),
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
  </script>
</body>
```

Our app is defined in a script tag. Everything in this book should be placed there.

Now let's talk about React.
