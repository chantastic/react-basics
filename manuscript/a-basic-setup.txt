# A Basic Setup

*Copy and paste this into file on your computer.* Open it in a browser to see a working React app.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <script src="https://fb.me/react-15.0.2.js"></script>
  <script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.2.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>

  <script>
    ReactDOM.render(
      React.createElement('div', { children: "Hi there" }),
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

# A Basic Setup (explained)

There are three distinct sections of this file.

## React and ReactDOM script tags

In the *head* of our HTML file, we're fetching versions of *React* and *ReactDOM*.

```
<script src="https://fb.me/react-15.0.2.js"></script>
<script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-15.0.2.js"></script>
```

*React* is the focus of this book.

*ReactDOM* is something we won't touch much but required for any browser-based React app.

## A Single Element

Every React app needs a single DOM element to attach to. Ours is a *div* with the id *"root"*.

```
<div id="root"></div>
```

## A Script Tag with React App

Finally, we have our React app in a *script* tag. It doesn't do much yet.

```
<script>
  ReactDOM.render(
    React.createElement('div', { children: "Hi there" }),
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
</script>
```
