# Class

Before we dive into React component classes,
you should know about a bit about JavaScript classes.

Like `const` and arrow functions, `class` was introduced with ES2015.
It's implemented in the latest version of all major browsers.
Don't believe me?
Try it out.

Type these lines into your dev tools console:

```
class Counter {}

const counterInstance = new Counter;

console.log(counterInstance)
// => Counter {}
```

It's a totally a thing.

classes can extend other classes.
We could create a `CardCounter` class that `extends` `Counter`.

We can also define a `constructor` to build new instances with initial values.

```
class ClickCounter extends Counter {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {clicks: 0};
  }
}

const clickCounterInstance = new ClickCounter;

console.log(clickCounterInstance.state);
// => {clicks: 0}
```

In the next chapter we'll extend React's `Component` class to create components with initial state values.
