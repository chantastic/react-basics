# End Here

You've done great. If you made it this far, you know enough about React to start building something.

Go, push the boundaries of what you know. You'll find out what you don't know. When you have some questions, move onto the next book.

Here are some ideas to get the creative juices flowing.

* Add other interactions to go along with our Click state. How many times a user scrolls, hits a key, or hovers.
* Write a component that fetches character info from one of the characters in the SWAPI or POKEAPI and presents it in a nice format. Bonus points if you use one component to handle state and pass them to another component with props.
  * The ids for both APIs are auto-incrementing. Start with id 1. Add a button that allows someone to go forward and backword through profiles.
* Create a stopwatch using setInterval to increment a timer
