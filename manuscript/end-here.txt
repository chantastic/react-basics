# End Here

## Congratulations

You did it!
You know everything you need to know to make interactive React components.

Start pushing the boundaries of what you've learned.
Make a tic-tac-toe game, a stopwatch, and a mock shopping cart.
You can do it all with what you've learned here.

## Next steps

As you play around with components, you'll need to learn more about forms.
Forms are notoriously tricky in React.
They've tripped up many a great developer.
I hope to cover this in another book.
Until then, the React documentation is your friend.
