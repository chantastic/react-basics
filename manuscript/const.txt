# const

`const` is a way of defining variables that cannot be reassigned.
Run these lines in your browser console.

```js
const example = "You can't change me."
example = "I'm gonna try."
// => TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

When you use `const` instead of `var`, you can't reassign that variable.

### What that means for React

If we use `const` to assign a React component to a variable, we can rest assured that variable will never be reassigned.

```
const MyComponent = (props) => React.createElement('div', "you can't change me!")
```
