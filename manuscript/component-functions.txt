# Our first component

We're going to make a component!

Components in React are easy.
Watch carefully or you might miss it.

## Creating a component function

Move the createElement call into a function and give it a name.
Name it `Greeting`.

```js
var Greeting = function () {
  return React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi" })
}
```

And because we're focusing on modern JavaScript, lets define this function with an arrow and `const`.

```js
const Greeting = () => React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi" })
```

## Rendering Components

To render our fresh-off-the-press component, update our *React.createElement* function to use the *Greeting* component we just defined.

```
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Greeting),
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```

All together, your app should look like this:

```
const Greeting = () => React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hi" })

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Greeting),
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```

Refresh your browser and everything should remain the same.
But something changed.
You made a new component!

## createElement takes functions

We've discovered a new truth about `React.createElement`.
`React.creatElement` can use a function to create new *React Elements*.

Good job. Pat yourself on the back!

### Try it out

* __Rename the component__. Does it still work?
* __Pass the *Greeting* function to *ReactDOM.render* directly__. What happens?
* __OK, put everything back__.
